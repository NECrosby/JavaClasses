/* *********************************************************************************\	
|  	Hints:																			|
|		Figure 32.10 may confuse this a bit. If this was to be a single-user type 	|
|		of program, it may seem overkill to have a separate Hurricane class 		|
|		(i.e. if the user enters a category of 3, in the event handler for this 	|
|		entry, it would be fairly easy, via a decision structure, to just generate 	|
|		the appropriate message). Broaden out to a bigger picture. Image there are 	|
|		multiple “clients” all listening for hurricane warnings. If a user enters 	|
|		a category 3, all listeners would want to know about it.					|
