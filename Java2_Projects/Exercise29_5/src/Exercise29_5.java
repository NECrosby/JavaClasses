|	(Simulation: a running fan) Write a Java applet that simulates a running fan, as	|
|	shown in Figure 18.19(b). The buttons Start, Stop, and Reverse control the fan.		|
|	The scrollbar controls the fan's speed. Create a class named Fan, a subclass of		|
|	JPanel, to display the fan. This class also contains the methods to suspend and		|
|	resume the fan, set its speed, and reverse its direction. Create a class named		|
|	FanControl that contains a fan, and three buttons and a scroll bar to control the	|
|	fan. Create a Java applet that contains an instance of FanControl.					|
